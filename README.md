# Llama 4 Multimodal Applications

A comprehensive collection of hands-on implementations and examples from the "Building with Llama 4" course by DeepLearning.AI, showcasing advanced multimodal and long-context GenAI applications using Meta's Llama 4 models.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and code examples that demonstrate the powerful capabilities of Llama 4, including its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, multimodal processing, and long-context understanding. All projects are based on the curriculum taught by Amit Sangani, Senior Director of Partner Engineering at Meta.

## 🧠 Key Features Implemented

- **Multimodal AI Applications**: Image understanding and processing with text generation
- **Long-Context Processing**: Handle up to 10 million tokens for large document analysis
- **Multilingual Translation**: Chatbot supporting 12+ languages
- **Image Grounding**: Object detection with bounding box identification
- **UI Screenshot Translation**: Convert visual interfaces to executable code
- **Prompt Optimization**: Enhanced sentiment analysis and categorization
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: High-quality dataset creation for model fine-tuning
